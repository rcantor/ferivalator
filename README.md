# ferivalator

This project contains layout for the Ferivalator, Feriva's Iron calculator. This calculates the Iron needed for your target Hb and Iron needed to replenish your body's stores. 

This also calculates how long it would take to reach those goals. 

I used javascript to do the calculations.
